instead of creating several variables in a single operation
we can simply create a single object(JSON) and store all related
variables in key-value pairs between curly braces

classes 

building objects are okay for simple or fairly small projects 
but when dealing with bigger projects its not the best option 
the class is more useful in this instance 

take for example, you want to automatically build an object for
each user who opens an account, you can create a class of objects 
with the parameters already spelt out and an object will the spelt
out immediately omeone creates an account

inn essence, having a class of account allows you to create new account
objects quicker and easier

Arrays

Array is a type of collection in javascript. it can store bot variables
and objects 
while the object is written within curly braces, arrays are squared brackets

dealing with arrays 

imagine weve created an array and we want to add an element to it we can use 2 methods 
.push or .unshift

arrays are ordered lists so adding elements to it will go to the end if we use the .push notation
to add an element to the beginning we use the .unshift methods


Removing elements from arrays
we use the .pop() method to remove the last element of the array
the .length notation will give the total elements in an array
