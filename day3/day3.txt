today we continue to learn about collrctions in javascript
starting with sets and maps

sets are unordered lists which means we cannot reliably retrieve
elements as they do not have a defined index of position 
an object or collection in sets can only appear once
though unordered, sets are useful in several things like 
storing who is online to determine who is not online

maps on the other hand are ordered lists of key value pair elements, though similar to objects
they have huge differences. while objects have keys in strings alone but any primitive data type
its content is easily accessible and you can modify its key value pairs in certain ways
