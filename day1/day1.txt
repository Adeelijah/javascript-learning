there are three primitive data types

numbers  //integers, positive, negatives and floats
strings  //they consist of letters contained in quotes
booleans //the simplest primitive data type True or False

Theres always a problem with floating point arithemetic in all programming languages
so to avoid your calculations throwing this error, multiply all floats by a hundred

example 
console.log(0.2 + 0.2);
this will give acorrect answer but

console.log(0.1 + 0.2);
will throw an error 

to be on a safer side multiply floats by 100
instead to 
let price = 12.99;

use 
let price = 1299
then you can run a function to return it to decimal later

concatenation of strings
strings can be added but they do not function in the same way as numbers

example 
let firstName = 'Elijah'
let lastName = "Tobi"

let name = (firstName + lastName)
this will concatenate (add) the lastName to the end of firstName
resulting in something like this 
name = "ElijahTobi"
to add a space in-between
let name = (firstName + ' ' + lastName)
