variable scoping

any variable that is declared in the inner scope is not available to the parent scope 
because they only exist within the inner code block. the console.log will therefore 
throw an error because the logged variable does not exist in the parent block.

switch statements
if else statements are good but when dealing with larger data and you need to run several if else
statements which wont make our code readable enough. this is where the switch statement comes in
with switch statements we can continue to pass our arguments and instances in more readable fashion 

loops

loops allow us to repeat a line of code as many times as we need or is neccessary for the code to run
there are two variations of loops

enumerated loops (for loops)
enumerated loops comes in two types
indexed
    here we can repeeat a block of code a pre-defined number of times of access a collection using its index number
    in essence each item in the collection is indexed and they are called based on their index number
and non-indexed loops
    in this case the items are not indexed they are just called by whats next in no particular order
    until all items are called

conditional loops (while loops)   
    conditional loops are used on the condition that a certain argument is yet to be met
    conditional loops comes in two flavours 
pre-validation
    here we have to validate the condition before the execution of the code block

and post-validation
    the validation is done after the execution of the code block
