A function is a block of code with a specific purpose to which you give a name. When you call that function, 
you execute the code it contains. For example, in the screencast videos, you've seen me call the  
console.log()  function, which contains code that prints stuff to the console.

Many functions require variables to do their job. When you create or declare a function,
you list the variables it requires to do its job: you set parameters for the function.

Then, when you call the function, you pass it values for those parameters. 
The values are called arguments.
