while loops
 while the argument is true, the loop continues to run until
 the argument is false

solving for runtime errors
wrapping our arguments in anif else statement
this will first check if the values we are logging to the cosole are existent and do the neccessary

another method is the try catch statement
 this will first try the statement if its true then throw an error if neccessary
 so this doesnt crash your code or give any error in the program
