conditions to control the flow of programs

conditional statements 
if else statements
  they are known as conditional statements that execute if the given
  parameters are met. for example if a user is logged in = take them to their homepage 
  else take them to the login page

instead of using the boolean values all the time we can also use the comparison operators
 greater tham >
 less than <
 equal to =
 greater than equal to >=
 less than equal to <=

when using expressions in if statements 
== is not the same as === because the latter checks for the type of the data

the tripple equals sign will authenticate if both data is of the same origin 
== is loose equality while
=== is strict equality

similarly there are two not equal to signs 
!= and !== whit the same distinctions


switch 
enumerations
